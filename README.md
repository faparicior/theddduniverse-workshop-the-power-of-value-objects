# Learn DDD Step by Step, Using "The DDD Universe" Cards

In this series of workshops, we will be working on a very basic and plain code. We will face small challenges to transform it into a structure more in line with the current DDD standards.

## Scenario

We are a startup that wants to bring back the simplicity of posting ads, imitating how it was done in the past. Previously, posters were glued on the streets or on bulletin boards advertising things. Our startup wants to revive that idea but in a digital format. Now, there are digital panels in civic centers, and we have an agreement to publish on them.

We start the proof of concept with a civic center near our offices.
